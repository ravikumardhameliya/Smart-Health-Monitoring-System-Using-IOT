# Smart Health Monitoring system Using IOT
IOT based Smart Health Monitoring System 

We aimed to develop a Smart Health Monitoring System with Internet of Thing (IoT). Portable healthcare monitoring systems with emerging technologies are becoming of great concern worldwide nowadays. This project proposes a smart health monitoring system in IoT environment that can monitor a patient’s basic health as well as the room temperature in real-time. In this system, using two sensors we capture data from Patient which are heart beat, O2 level, room temperature and body temperature. Patient’s health parameters should be in certain limit which indicates the normal case or emergency case. Doctors and healthcare staff can use it in order to monitor and check their condition via Cloud services. The doctors can be alerted if patients are required instant treatment or not. The developed prototype is well suited for health monitoring that is proved by the effectiveness of the system.
